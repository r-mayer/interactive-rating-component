# Interactive rating component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI).

## Overview

### The challenge

In this challenge, I had to use the knowledge I already had in HTML and CSS and train the DOM manipulation with Javascript to show the two states, and also use variables to store the grade given by the user.

It was also nice to style the "radio" inputs, using the ::before and ::after pseudo elements.
